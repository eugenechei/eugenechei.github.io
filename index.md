### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was one of my most intriguing lab assignments. To be able to make my first animation broadened my perspective, because it allowed me to understand how digital images are displayed through coding. I've always wondered how computer science and digital images can go hand to hand. Since I synthesized and manipulated a visual content, it made me wonder how computer science can be used extensively in a wide range of various domains within the entertainment industry.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 has enabled me to understand how user inputs from the command-line can be written on a separate file. For the first half of the semester, I was only taught how to write code for a particular purpose on a single C++ file. After completing this assignment, I was introduced to the notion that codes and inputs from the command-line can be written beyond the main file. Now I possess a skill to transfer or communicate the outputs of my functions to other files.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was an assignment that pertained to spell checking. Most, if not all, have used a word processor, such as Microsoft Word and within that program there is a feature which many have used called "Spell Check". This assignment has helped me understand one method of spell checking a document full of text. Before this assignment, I never understood how a block of code can spell check a panoply of words. It was interesting to know that there exist a set of words that has meaning in the English language and it is used to check whether the words are within those parameters.
